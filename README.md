This code performs calculations realted to the ORM in the given lattice. There are modules to calculate the ORM using analytical formulas and to calculate it numerically using ATcollab. 

The object of most interess is the derivative of the orbit response matrix with respect to quadrupole strength. This can be calculated numerically by calculating the ORM for different quadrupole strengths and using a finite difference.

A high fidelity for the betatrone tune formula is observed (as to be expected as it is exact in the linear regime even when considering thick elements

On the other hand, formulas for the derivative in thin lens aproximation show a good enough fidelity with error around 10%
